# Vein-detection-using-deep-learning-
This project focuses on real-time detection and segmentation of jugular and peripheral veins using deep learning, specifically YOLOv11-based instance segmentation. Developed as part of a research internship at IIT Hyderabad, the goal was to create a lightweight, deployable system for non-invasive medical imaging, especially useful in emergency
